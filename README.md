# Crater-CVE-2023-46865-RCE
Crater &lt;=6.0.6, CVE-2023-46865 Post-Auth RCE (Superadmin)

## Vulnerability Description

Crater Invoice is vulnerable to unrestricted file upload with dangerous type due to lack of proper input validation. The Base64Mime checking class can be bypassed by embedding a valid PHP payload into an IDAT image chunk. A user with superadmin privileges is able to upload the crafted payload through company logo at /api/v1/company/upload-logo.

Although a superadmin privileges is needed for the exploit which means the  customer invoice was already compromised, we can demonstrate a higher impact since we can gain code execution on OS level. The fact that the vulnerability required superadmin privilege to be authenticated, which can cause a big problem. What we wanted to demonstrate here is the code execution via IDAT image processing.
